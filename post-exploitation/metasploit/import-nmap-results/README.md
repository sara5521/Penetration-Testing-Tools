# ðŸ“¥ Importing Nmap Scan Results Into Metasploit

This lab teaches you how to import Nmap scan results into Metasploitâ€™s database. This is very useful in post-exploitation or organized service enumeration workflows.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Lab Goal

Instead of repeating scans every time, you can:
- Perform a full scan with **Nmap**
- Save the results as an XML file
- Import that XML into **Metasploit Framework (MSF)**
- Use built-in Metasploit commands like `hosts`, `services`, `vulns` to analyze the data

---

## ðŸ§ª Step-by-Step Lab Walkthrough

### âœ… Step 1: Ping the Target
```bash
ping -c 4 demo.ine.local
```
Make sure the target is alive and reachable.

---

### âœ… Step 2: Nmap Scan and Save as XML
```bash
nmap -sV -Pn -oX myscan.xml demo.ine.local
```
- `-sV` â†’ Service/version detection  
- `-Pn` â†’ Treat host as online  
- `-oX` â†’ Save output as XML (for import into MSF)  

---

### âœ… Step 3: Start PostgreSQL Database
```bash
service postgresql start
```

---

### âœ… Step 4: Launch Metasploit Console
```bash
msfconsole
```

---

### âœ… Step 5: Check Database Status
```bash
db_status
```
Expected: `[*] Connected to msf. Connection type: postgresql.`

---

### âœ… Step 6: Import Nmap XML Results
```bash
db_import myscan.xml
```

---

### âœ… Step 7: View Hosts and Services

#### ðŸ”¹ View Hosts
```bash
hosts
```

#### ðŸ”¹ View Services
```bash
services
```

---

## ðŸ§  Why is This Useful?
- Centralized scan storage in MSF
- Easy post-exploitation targeting
- Launch exploits directly from MSF database

---

## ðŸ“Œ Sample Nmap Output
```
PORT      STATE SERVICE            VERSION
80/tcp    open  http               HttpFileServer httpd 2.3
135/tcp   open  msrpc              Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn        Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds       Windows Server 2008 R2 - 2012
3389/tcp  open  ssl/ms-wbt-server? Remote Desktop (RDP)
49154/tcp open  msrpc              Microsoft Windows RPC
49155/tcp open  msrpc              Microsoft Windows RPC
```
