# 🧪 Importing Nmap Scan Results Into Metasploit

This lab demonstrates how to import Nmap XML scan results into Metasploit and use them for post-exploitation analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Run a full Nmap scan
- Save output as XML
- Import the results into Metasploit
- Analyze hosts, services, and vulnerabilities inside MSF

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- 🛠️ Nmap
- 🧨 Metasploit Framework

---

## 🔢 Steps

### 1️⃣ Run a Full Nmap Scan and Save to XML
```bash
nmap -sS -sV -Pn -T4 -oX demo-nmap.xml demo.ine.local
```

### 2️⃣ Start Metasploit Console
```bash
msfconsole
```
Then import the XML file:
```bash
db_import /path/to/demo-nmap.xml
```

### 3️⃣ View Imported Hosts and Services
```bash
hosts
services
```

### 4️⃣ Analyze the Target
```bash
vulns
```
You can also run:
```bash
workspace -a demo-lab
services -u
```

#### 🧠 Notes
- You can import results from other scanners (Nessus, OpenVAS) the same way.
- Metasploit uses this data for automated exploitation.
- Use `db_nmap` to scan directly from within msfconsole.

#### 🏁 Summary
Using Nmap XML results allows for better integration with MSF. This workflow is useful during real-world assessments to streamline enumeration, analysis, and exploitation.
