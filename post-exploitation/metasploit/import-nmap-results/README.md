# üß™ Importing Nmap Scan Results Into Metasploit

This lab demonstrates how to import Nmap XML scan results into the Metasploit Framework (MSF) for deeper host and service analysis.

---

## üéØ Objective

- Verify the target is online
- Run Nmap with version detection and export as XML
- Start PostgreSQL for Metasploit's database backend
- Import Nmap results into MSF
- List hosts and services within the MSF database

---

## üß∞ Tools Used

- `nmap`
- `msfconsole`
- `PostgreSQL` (for Metasploit database)
- Target: `demo.ine.local`

---

## üî¢ Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ping the Target

Check if the host is reachable:

```bash
ping -c 4 demo.ine.local
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run Nmap with Version Detection and Save as XML

```bash
nmap -sV -Pn -oX myscan.xml demo.ine.local
```

- `-sV`: Detect service versions  
- `-Pn`: Skip host discovery (assume host is up)  
- `-oX`: Export output as XML

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start PostgreSQL (Metasploit Database)

```bash
service postgresql start
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Launch Metasploit Console

```bash
msfconsole
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Check Database Connection

```bash
db_status
```

- Expected Output:  
  `[*] Connected to msf...`

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Import the Nmap Scan Results

```bash
db_import myscan.xml
```

- You should see:  
  `[*] Importing 'Nmap XML' data`

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ View the Hosts and Services in the Database

```bash
hosts
services
```

- `hosts`: Displays imported hosts  
- `services`: Displays open ports and detected services

---

## üß† Notes

- You can use `db_nmap` to scan directly from MSF instead of using `nmap` externally.
- You must have the PostgreSQL service running before importing data.
- Other file formats supported by `db_import`: Nessus XML, OpenVAS, etc.

---

## üèÅ Summary

Using `db_import` to bring Nmap data into Metasploit helps centralize enumeration. This allows you to run post-exploitation modules based on real-time scanned data.
